    "### Chapter 6: Synchronization Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.1**\n",
    "*   **Question:** If the current value of counter = 5, what are its possible values if the producer and consumer processes run concurrently?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** 4, 5, or 6. Due to a race condition from the concurrent execution of the `counter++` and `counter--` operations without synchronization, the final value may be incorrect (should remain 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.2**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the term for describing the situation where shared data may be manipulated concurrently and the outcome of the execution depends upon the order of access?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Race condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.3**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the term used to describe the segment of code where shared data is accessed and possibly manipulated?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Critical section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.4**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the three requirements a solution to the critical-section problem must satisfy?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** 1) Mutual exclusion, 2) Progress, 3) Bounded waiting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.5**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? A nonpreemptive kernel is essentially free from race conditions.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True (within kernel mode). In a nonpreemptive kernel, a process running in kernel mode cannot be preempted, preventing race conditions on kernel data structures. Race conditions are still possible between user processes sharing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.6**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? There are no guarantees Peterson’s solution works correctly on modern computer architectures.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. Peterson's solution assumes sequential consistency of memory accesses (i.e., that load and store instructions are executed in the order they appear in the code). Modern architectures with performance optimizations (e.g., memory reordering, cache hierarchies) may violate this assumption, breaking the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.7**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? All solutions to the critical section problem are based on the premise of locking.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** False. While many solutions use locks (mutexes, semaphores), other approaches exist, such as lock-free or wait-free algorithms that use atomic hardware instructions (like compare-and-swap) to achieve synchronization without traditional locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.8**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two general hardware instructions that can be performed atomically?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Test-and-set and compare-and-swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.9**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two functions used with mutex locks?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** `acquire()` (or `lock()`) and `release()` (or `unlock()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.10**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? A spinlock is a type of mutex lock.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. A spinlock is a type of mutex lock where a process \"spins\" (busy-waits) in a loop repeatedly checking the lock's availability instead of sleeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.11**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? Semaphores can provide the same functionality as mutex locks.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. A binary semaphore (initialized to 1) can be used to enforce mutual exclusion, providing the same basic functionality as a mutex lock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.12**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two operations that can be performed on a semaphore?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** `wait()` (or `P()`) and `signal()` (or `V()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.13**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? A binary semaphore is functionally equivalent to a mutex lock.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True, with a key distinction. A binary semaphore (value 0 or 1) can enforce mutual exclusion. However, a mutex lock typically has the concept of ownership (only the thread that acquired it can release it), while a semaphore does not inherently enforce this.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.14**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two operations that can be performed on a condition variable?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** `wait()` and `signal()` (or `notify()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.15**\n",
    "*   **Question:** Name at least one modern programming language that has incorporated the idea of a monitor.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Java (synchronized methods/blocks and `wait()`, `notify()`), C# (`lock` statement and `Monitor.Wait()`, `Monitor.Pulse()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.16**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? The system model for deadlocks first requires a process request a resource, then use the resource, and finally release the resource.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. The standard resource usage model is: Request → Use → Release.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.17**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the four necessary conditions for characterizing deadlock?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** 1) Mutual exclusion, 2) Hold and wait, 3) No preemption, 4) Circular wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.18**\n",
    "*   **Question:** Describe one strategy for dealing with deadlocks?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** One strategy is deadlock prevention, which ensures that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold (e.g., requiring processes to request all resources before starting to break \"hold and wait\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 6.19**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the only reasonable condition that can be used to prevent deadlocks?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** The \"circular wait\" condition is generally considered the most reasonable to prevent, as it can be avoided by imposing a total ordering of all resource types and requiring that processes request resources in an increasing order of enumeration."
