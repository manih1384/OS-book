    "### Chapter 5: CPU Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.1**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two bursts that CPU schedulers are designed around?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** CPU bursts and I/O bursts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.2**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? Under preemptive scheduling, when a process switches from the running to the ready state, it may lose control of the CPU.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. In preemptive scheduling, the scheduler can interrupt a running process (e.g., when a higher-priority process becomes ready or a time quantum expires) and reassign the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.3**\n",
    "*   **Question:** List at least three different criteria for designing a CPU scheduling algorithm.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** CPU utilization, throughput, turnaround time, waiting time, response time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.4**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process with the highest priority?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Priority scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.5**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? The multilevel feedback queue scheduling algorithm allows processes to migrate between different queues.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. A key feature of the Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) scheduler is that processes can move between queues based on their observed behavior (e.g., CPU-bound processes may be moved to lower-priority queues).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.6**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process that first requested it?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.7**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to a process for only its time slice (or time quantum)?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Round-Robin (RR) scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.8**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What scheduling algorithm assigns the CPU to the process with the shortest burst?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling (or Shortest-Process-Next, SPN).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.9**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two types of contention scope for thread scheduling?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Process-contention scope (PCS) and system-contention scope (SCS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.10**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two general hardware instructions that can be performed atomically?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Test-and-set and compare-and-swap (or swap)."

    "**Review Question 5.11**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is more common on current systems, asymmetric or symmetric multiprocessing?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.12**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two forms of processor affinity?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Soft affinity (the operating system tries to keep a process on the same processor but does not guarantee it) and hard affinity (allows a process to specify a set of processors on which it may run).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.13**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two general approaches for load balancing?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Push migration (a specific task periodically checks the load on each processor and redistributes processes if needed) and pull migration (an idle processor pulls a waiting task from a busy processor).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.14**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two ways to multithread a processing core?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Coarse-grained multithreading and fine-grained multithreading (also known as simultaneous multithreading, SMT, in its most common modern form, e.g., Intel's Hyper-Threading).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.15**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two general types of real-time scheduling?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Soft real-time scheduling and hard real-time scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.16**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What real-time scheduling algorithm uses deadline as its scheduling criteria?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Earliest-Deadline-First (EDF) scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.17**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What real-time scheduling algorithm is used for scheduling periodic tasks with static priorities?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Rate-Monotonic Scheduling (RMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.18**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the name of the default scheduling algorithm for current Linux systems?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** The Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.19**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? A Windows thread is assigned both a priority class and a relative priority within that class.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. Each thread has a base priority determined by its process's priority class and its own relative priority within that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.20**\n",
    "*   **Question:** If a thread on a Solaris system exhausts its time quantum, will it later be assigned a higher or lower priority?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Lower priority. In the traditional Solaris time-sharing (TS) class, a thread that uses its entire time quantum is considered CPU-bound and has its priority lowered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 5.21**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? Deterministic modeling and simulations are similar strategies for evaluating scheduling algorithms.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** False. They are different strategies. Deterministic modeling uses a predetermined workload (e.g., a fixed set of processes with known burst times) to compute performance metrics analytically. Simulation involves modeling a system (e.g., with software) and evaluating algorithm performance using more complex, often probabilistic, workloads."
