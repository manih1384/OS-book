    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.1**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the names of the two processes associated with the bounded-buffer problem?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Producer and Consumer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.2**\n",
    "*   **Question:** How many writers may concurrently share the database with the readers-writers problem?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Only one writer may have exclusive access to the database at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.3**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the problem if all philosophers simultaneously pick up their left fork?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Deadlock. Each philosopher would hold one fork and wait indefinitely for their right fork (which is held by their neighbor), creating a circular wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.4**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the two states of a Windows dispatcher object?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Signaled state and nonsignaled state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.5**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is available in Linux for updating an integer variable without having to use locks?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Atomic integers (the `atomic_t` type and associated atomic operations like `atomic_inc()`, `atomic_dec()`, `atomic_read()`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.6**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? Linux uses spinlocks for both single and multiple processor systems.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** False. Linux disables kernel preemption for spinlocks on single-processor systems (making them act as no-ops in non-preemptive sections) and uses actual busy-waiting spinlocks only on multiprocessor systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.7**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the Pthreads operations for locking and unlocking a mutex lock?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** `pthread_mutex_lock()` and `pthread_mutex_unlock()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 7.8**\n",
    "*   **Question:** Provide at least one alternative to mutex locks, semaphores, reader-writer locks, and monitors that provide support for concurrent programming.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** OpenMP (using compiler directives for parallelism), functional programming languages (which use immutable data and avoid state), transactional memory, or lock-free/wait-free data structures (using atomic operations like CAS)."
