    "### Chapter 8: Deadlocks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.1**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? The system model for deadlocks first requires a process request a resource, then use the resource, and finally release the resource.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. The standard resource usage model is: Request → Use → Release.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.2**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What are the four necessary conditions for characterizing deadlock?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** 1) Mutual Exclusion, 2) Hold and Wait, 3) No Preemption, 4) Circular Wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.3**\n",
    "*   **Question:** Describe one strategy for dealing with deadlocks.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** One strategy is **Deadlock Prevention**, which ensures that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold (e.g., requiring processes to request all resources before starting to break \"hold and wait\").\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.4**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the only reasonable condition that can be used to prevent deadlocks from occurring?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** The \"Circular Wait\" condition is generally considered the most practical to prevent, typically by imposing a total ordering of all resource types and requiring that processes request resources in an increasing order of enumeration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.5**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the name of the state of the system if resources can be allocated to all processes in some order and deadlock can still be avoided?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Safe state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.6**\n",
    "*   **Question:** What is the name of the classic deadlock avoidance algorithm?\n",
    "*   **Answer:** The banker's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.7**\n",
    "*   **Question:** True or False? The wait-for graph can only be used for deadlock detection when there is a single instance of each resource type.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** True. The standard wait-for graph detection method applies to systems where each resource type has exactly one instance. For multiple instances, a more generalized algorithm (like the Banker's algorithm variant for detection) is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Review Question 8.8**\n",
    "*   **Question:** Provide at least one method for recovering from deadlock.\n",
    "*   **Answer:** Process termination (aborting one or more deadlocked processes) or resource preemption (forcibly taking resources from some processes and giving them to others)."
