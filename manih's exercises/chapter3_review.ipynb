    "## **3.3 Complications of Concurrent Processing**\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Original versions of Apple’s mobile iOS operating system provided no means of concurrent processing. Discuss three major complications that concurrent processing adds to an operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "a. The CPU scheduler must be aware of the different concurrent processes and must choose an appropriate algorithm for scheduling them.\n",
    "b. Concurrent processes often need to communicate with one another, requiring the operating system to provide methods for interprocess communication.\n",
    "c. With limited memory on devices, poor memory management by one process can negatively impact others, so the OS must carefully manage memory to support multiple concurrent processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.5 Shared Process Memory after fork()**\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: When a process creates a new process using the `fork()` operation, which of the following states is shared between the parent process and the child process?\n",
    "a. Stack\n",
    "b. Heap\n",
    "c. Shared memory segments\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Only the shared memory segments are shared between the parent process and the newly forked child process. Copies of the stack and the heap are made for the newly created process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3.6 \"Exactly Once\" RPC Semantics with Lost ACK**\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: Consider the “exactly once” semantic with respect to the RPC mechanism. Does the algorithm for implementing this semantic execute correctly even if the ACK message sent back to the client is lost due to a network problem? Describe the sequence of messages, and discuss whether “exactly once” is still preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Yes, \"exactly once\" is still preserved. The client sends an RPC with a timestamp and starts a timer. If the ACK is lost, the client times out and resends the RPC with a new timestamp. When the server receives this duplicate RPC, it uses the timestamp to identify it as a duplicate, does not re-execute the procedure, and resends the ACK. This sequence ensures the remote procedure is executed exactly once.\n"
